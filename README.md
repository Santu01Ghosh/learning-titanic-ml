## Titanic Dataset - Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my learning and practice work with the Titanic dataset, where I explored multiple machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival.

🔍 What I did

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on passenger features

Applied multiple ML algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Trees & Random Forests

(Add more if you used them 🚀)

Used cross-validation to evaluate model performance
